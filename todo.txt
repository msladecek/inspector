A clojure data inspector for the terminal.
Something like reveal[1] or portal[2] or cider-inspect[3] but running in a terminal.

Multiple ways of running it:
1. As a separate thing that gets connected during repl session, like portal
2. As a wrapper for the clojure cli that starts nrepl and enables the tap / inspector output automatically.
